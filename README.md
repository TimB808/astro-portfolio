# Astro Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site, built using Astro with some JavaScript enhancements and CSS styling. It's based on the [Astro Starter Kit: Portfolio](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/portfolio) and deployed through Cloudflare Pages. Significant modifications have been made.
